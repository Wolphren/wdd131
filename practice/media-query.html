            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go 
                and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that 
                the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save 
                he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the 
                thing which he commandeth them.</p>

            <h2>Ether 12:6</h2>
            <p>And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; 
                I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped 
                for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for 
                ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</p>
