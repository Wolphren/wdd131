      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am creating a personal website to showcase my achievements, 
        projects, and professional experience. The main page will introduce 
        who I am and include links to my resume and a detailed portfolio 
        of my work. This site will be a visually appealing and user-friendly 
        platform. My goal is to present my work in a clear, engaging, 
        and professional manner.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site will be designed to make it easy for potential employers and 
        others to access my skills and accomplishments without feeling 
        overwhelmed.</p> 

      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
      <p>JavaScript will be used to add interactivity to my portfolio website. I 
        will implement a theme toggle switch for dark/light mode and a filtering system 
        for project categories. These 
        features will enhance the user experience and engagement.</p>

      <h1>Who am I</h1>
      <p> I am Wade Davenport the 2nd oldest from a family of 5 kids. I love to climb trees, hike, and go camping. I also enjoy reading, anime, and computer games.
        From a young age, I have been good at math and puzzles so I have been interested in a career in Computers. However, I am not afraid of physical labor and hard work. 
        My parents and Grandparents have both had farms so I have gotten used to taking care of animals and hard work. While my interests are in computers I also have learned many physical skills over the course of my life. I enjoy helping others and am always willing to reach out and help when asked. I enjoy figuring things out and learning new things. I am always open for constructive criticism and want to learn how I can do better and improve myself.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        I do not have the code for any of my projects at this moment so this will be a placeholder for now
        There will be defined sections for the different types of projects that are completed.
        I plan to add more projects as they become completed in the future in the following format:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Description (possibility of image)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I am currently working on two different projects at the moment: 
        One is a game where you change the player to the same color as the incoming obstacles which gets increasingly more fast paced the longer you play
        A Zork-esc game where it is mostly text-based and played in a terminal
      </p>
      <h4>Mindfulness Program</h4>
      <p>
        A terminal based program that has 3 different mindfulness exercises. A breathing exercise, a listening exercise, and a reflection exercise. For each you can do each for a time of your choosing before being escorted back to the main menu.
      </p>
      <h4>Journal Program</h4>
      <p>
        A terminal based Journal where you can write journal entries and are given a random prompt. You can display your current entries and then save them in a file. You can also load the file again later if you want to continue writing more journal entries.
      </p>
      <h4>Goal Setting Program</h4>
      <p>
        A terminal based program where you can create 3 different types of goals: a simple goal, a checklist goal, and an ongoing goal. You can then check of these goals for points and then display your total score.
      </p>
      <h4>Scripture Memorization Program</h4>
      <p>
        This is a terminal program with a set scripture. As you press the enter key you will slowly replace the words in the scripture with blank lines helping you memorize the scripture. The program ends when all the words have disappeared or you quit the program.
